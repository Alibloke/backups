# NAS

The `NAS` server runs a number of services, and also is used to kick off backups of some other devices.

As the machine is a Linux machine, a number of different things must be backed up. In order to keep with the same format used for other devices, these are split into indivdual files describing the backup

# Backed Up items
## [System Config](config/README.md)
## [Networking Backups](networking_backups/README.md)

# Backups run from device
